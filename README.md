# Scalable-Machine-Learning-Research

This Github repository contains part of the code for my master thesis "Scalable Machine Learning with Multimedia Data". 
The code in this repository contains source code and configuration files for the execution of machine learning scenarios on an 
Apache Spark cluster. The master thesis will be finalized till the end of August 2017. Till then this repository 
should be regarded as work in progress
